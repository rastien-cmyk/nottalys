## 🧠 Concept

NOTTALYS offers couples a way to turn their love story into a custom song:

## ⚙️ Technical Stack

- Eleventy (static site generator)
- HTML / Nunjucks
- Tailwind CSS
- Alpine.js
- Lottie animations
- GitHub Actions for deployment
- GitHub Pages hosting

The stack was intentionally kept:
- simple
- lightweight
- easy to maintain
- focused on performance

## 🤖 Use of AI

AI tools were used as production accelerators:
- Claude (Anthropic) was used to assist with development and debugging
- Generative AI was used to produce concept videos and music samples

Design decisions, UX structure and product vision remain human-driven.

## 🚀 Deployment

The website is automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions.

Workflow:
1. Push to `main` branch
2. Eleventy builds the static site
3. Output is deployed to GitHub Pages

This setup reflects a real-world MVP deployment process.
